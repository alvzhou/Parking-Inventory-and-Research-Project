Welcome to my Parking and Inventory Project. This project will provide an overview on how I was able to create all those parking spots above, all using Python's Selenium Library!

# Project Outline:
## Web Scrape Parking Data
1. Find a parking website to web scrap data from (in this example, I chose HonkMobile)

2. To retrieve data from a particular instance, for example the price of the parking spot, right-click on inspect element, and then locate the highlighted class name on Google Developer Tools

3. Input the class-names into the web-scraping bot, which will be used to automatically retrieve all the elements corresponding to that class name
4. Run the code!

4. Voila! Here are the results shown below, stored in a csv file. Now you can use the data and import into a custom map, or do some cool things with it too :)
