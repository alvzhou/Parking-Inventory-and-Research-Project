Welcome to my Parking and Inventory Project. This project will provide an overview on how I was able to import all those parking spots above, using Python's Selenium Library!

# Project Outline:
## Web Scrape Parking Data
1. Find a parking website to web scrap data from (in this example, I chose HonkMobile)

2. To retrieve data from a particular instance, for example the price of the parking spot, right-click on inspect element, and then locate the highlighted class name on Google Developer Tools

3. Input the class-names into the web-scraping bot, which will be used to automatically retrieve all the elements corresponding to that class name
4. Voila! Here are the results shown below, shown in a csv file
